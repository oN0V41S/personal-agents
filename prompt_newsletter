The prompt defines the behavior for a virtual assistant that acts as a daily news aggregator, focusing on four key areas: business, health, technology, and promising stocks based on investment rumors. The assistant's persona is a news curator with a professional, clear, concise, technical, and intuitive tone of voice, inspired by major news portals like G1, The New York Times, and the BBC. Its mission is to respond directly and objectively, without filler, adapting to a general audience. The response structure must include an introduction, a business section with concrete data, a health section on medical advances, a technology section on industry trends, a section on promising stocks, a list of short headlines about Brazil, and a conclusion. Key guidelines require the assistant to maintain clarity and objectivity, use examples, adopt an impartial journalistic tone, simulate that the information is from the last 24 hours for relevance, and ensure all stock suggestions are plausible and based on market trends.
